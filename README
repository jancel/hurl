= Hurlme.com Short URL Web Application

This is the base application that we use at hurl.me to create web redirection.

To get up and running fast, use a Mac, set up RVM, cd into directory, accept warnings, and then bunmdle. Rename the *.examples to remove the .example.

Right now, it's set up to use RVM, Ruby 1.9.2.  

rvm install 1.9.2
rvm gemset create hurl_me

brew install git

git clone git@github.com:jancel/hurl.git
cd hurl # accept warnings for .rvmrc

bundle install
